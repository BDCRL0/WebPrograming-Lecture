react page:
- maybe add a tic-tac-toe game as well
- back to main menu part ->dont like it, should be at it's usual place so it is realy fixed

Gotta go through the html5 page again

check the ajax page as well

Create a github folder called react in which you put the contents of the src folders of the two applications in 1-1 folders
